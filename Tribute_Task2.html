         for intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.

Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics. He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University)
 to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering. According to Rajput, he did not have any 
 interest in engineering but his family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted to become an astronaut
  and later an air force pilot but was also interested in Bollywood, being a fan of Shah Rukh Khan.
